# ESX_THIEF เวอร์ชั้นที่กำหนดให้มีกุจแจมือ

Editted Version of the [esx_thief](https://github.com/ESX-PUBLIC/esx_thief) script.

In this version when pressing "G" (Can be edited line 371 in Client.lua) a menu to cuff / uncuff / search / move appears. 

You must use my handsup script for this to work or alter your one to work like mine (i will not help alter your script)

Nothing more to it really...
